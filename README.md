# SpeakingShirt — Posthuman Dialog Agent

A poetic, terminal-inspired, mobile-first chat website for an art installation. Visitors interact with an AI persona (shirt_01) via a QR code. The AI responds in a precise-poetic, slightly fragmented style, simulating a deconstructed men’s shirt with a coded voice.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
